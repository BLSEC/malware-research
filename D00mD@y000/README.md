CAUTION: THIS IS A LIVE SAMPLE

Build and run at your own risk, ideally in a virtual machine you don't care about as it will encrypt your files. For added safety, remember to disconnect your shared folders or set them to read-only.

This is for research and educational purposes only! I claim no responsibility for any damage due to negligence or malicious use. If you do get any ideas, just know that you are most likely not good or smart enough to not get caught. This sample is not very sophisticated and makes no attempts to cover its tracks.

Skids, you have been warned.
